# evaluation
'''
The returned eval_results object is a dict-object, whose keys are the object classes like car, person, etc.,
as well as an additional "mean", which means the mean average recall of all objects. The values of this dict
are numpy arrays, which record how the recall change when number of proposal grows. For example,
eval_results['car'][99] means the average recall of cars when 100 objects are accepted.
